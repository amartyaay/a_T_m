We can't cancel it or the amount will not credit. Stuck In the middle.\", \"It's a scam guys don't trust the app... They do the e- mandate and do not disburse the amount. But in the app it will show as processing. It's been more than 2 weeks and have not got funds not they are canceling it. I have written several mails but they don't respond. Also they don't have any calling number. Just beware of the fake app. You will never get the loan.\", \"Worst app I've ever used. They don't have money to disburse but still they approve your loan and you have to wait till the funds are available then they will pay and even if you raise the ticket multiple times. They are neither going to listen nor respond. Just an automated email, that's all. Alas, the worst experience would have been if I couldn't apply. Now I am stuck because I have no option to cancel.\", \"Definitely Looks Like A SCAM!!! My loan agreement was signed and the eNach mandate received 10 days ago. I have raised multiple tickets to no avail. The repayment date and amount has started reflecting on the app but the amount has not been disbursed even now. When I raised the first ticket it was closed without being resolved and it was just an automated email to begin with.

For sure it's not an instant loan app. Let's see if money ever hits my bank.

They gave the credit line, when applied for loan, it shows up processing, it has been more than 24 hours. For sure it\\'s not an instant loan app. Let\\'s see if money ever hits my bank. No customer care number. Total waste of time. Now on 2/7/2024, got a whatsApp notification if I want to cancel the loan application. Selected \"cancel\". In app it still appears to be in process. Credit limit that was deducted has not been restored yet. No proper customer service.', \"Am using this app for past many months. This is the first time I'm facing something like this. Now it's showing the credit lines and I have applied for it, signing everything is done but still it's showing status as processing. Amount not disbursed. When I raised ticket it's automatically getting closed without solving the issue. I have raised for three times. 2 are closed without Even taking nesscary actions. One is still open from February 10th and haven't received any confirmations regarding\", \"Worst experience from this app. I have applied for the loan on 4th Feb 24. Still it is showing as processing as it's already completed 6 days. I have mailed them so many times there is no response from them. They always send the system generated mails. There is no customer service for this app. Actually customers apply for emergency. They never give any response.

They never give any response. Such a time waste application.\", 'I have applied for loan and it has been 2 weeks. It has been approved and completed the enach and agreement. But not received the amount. I have raised ticket but no respose. I have mailed multiple times but only once they have replied with the generic response. When following up with it or dropping a fresh mail, there is no response. This is worst experience I have got and now I am not able to login to the app.', \"Worst application ever. They have approved the loan amount twice, firstly on Jan 15 but the loan amount was not disbursed. Yesterday a customer care executive asked to apply again, did that and again the loan is approved but amount has not been credited till now. They don't have a customer care number to contact. If you raise ticket they just have a standard template of higher than expected volume. They will send the same mails again and again. So far the experience has been frustrating.\", 'My loan agreement was signed 2 days ago and during the call before signing the agreement they said they will disburse the loan amount within half an hour after the process. But till today my loan amount was not credited and the status was showing as processing with EMI date and amount both are showing in the app without disburse of loan. Even though I raised multiple tickets they closed them without resolving issue. From today the app was not even opening, it was showing a error code.
